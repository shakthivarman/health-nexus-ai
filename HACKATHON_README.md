# 🏆 Health Nexus AI - Hackathon Ready!

## 🚀 What We Built

A **complete AI-powered healthcare platform** using **Azure AI services** with 5 specialized agents:

### 🤖 AI Agents
1. **Radiology Agent** - Analyzes medical images (X-rays, CT scans) using Azure Computer Vision + OpenAI
2. **Lab Results Agent** - Processes blood work and lab tests using Azure OpenAI
3. **Genomic Agent** - Analyzes genetic data and variants using Azure OpenAI
4. **Pathology Agent** - Processes tissue samples using Azure Custom Vision + OpenAI
5. **Orchestrator Agent** - Synthesizes all findings using Azure OpenAI

### ✨ Key Features
- **Real-time AI processing** with live status monitoring
- **Interactive chat interface** powered by Azure OpenAI
- **Multi-modal analysis** (text, images, structured data)
- **Confidence scoring** and detailed medical insights
- **One-click demo system** for easy presentation
